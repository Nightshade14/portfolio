  Hello! I am Satyam Chatrola. I am pursing MS in Computer Science at New York University (NYU).
  <br><br>
 As a Data Scientist and a Master's student in Computer Science at New York University, I am passionate about exploring and applying cutting-edge AI technologies, 
 such as Transformers, Generative AI, and Large Language Models, to drive innovation and solve complex problems. At Rapidops Inc., I spearheaded the development of a smart face recognition-based 
 attendance system, enhancing productivity tracking and authentication processes for 500+ employees. I also improved the AI-powered search and recommendation engine, using custom taggers 
 and Learning To Rank (LTR) techniques to serve results in 10ms. Furthermore, I conducted R&D on deep learning models to translate natural language queries into SQL commands, 
 enhancing database interaction. I received the 'Best Intern' award for my significant contributions to the recommendation system project, which integrated market basket analysis to 
 boost user experiences and business revenue.
